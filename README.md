## Gravity Simulation in Godot

A basic gravity sim in Godot. You can create and modify gravity objects in 2D, and also view a 3D sim. For now, I don't plan on making the 3D sim editable, as I feel it would be significantly more work.

In the 2D sim, you can use the UI to modify the properties of a gravity object, then right click to create it. You can also toggle boundaries around the edge of the camera, which will stop any objects going off screen.

You can press Escape anytime to quit or return to the menu.
